##Innovative Features##

To enhance the user profile experience beyond a static replica, I implemented two product-focused innovations:

#1. AI Smart Bio Generator#

Users can automatically generate a professional profile bio using AI based on their skills, career goals, and experience. This reduces the effort required to write a compelling summary and helps users present themselves professionally. The generated bio can be edited and saved, ensuring personalization and accuracy.

#2. Dark Mode with Persistent Preference#

The application includes a dark mode theme toggle that improves visual comfort and accessibility. The selected theme is stored locally, ensuring the user’s preference persists across sessions and page reloads. This enhances usability and modernizes the overall user experience.
